            This is my old portfolio website for web development, and the first project I ever created at Coder Academy AU. This was an assessible project that we built after a few weeks of learning HTML and CSS. <br><br>

            My aim with this portfolio was to make something that felt different to other portfolios I was seeing at the time. While researching the portfolio designs of other developers in the lead up to building my own, I found that many of these websites felt very impersonal and corporate. Conversely, I wanted a website that would represent who I am - a creative person with a deep love of front-end web design.<br><br>

            I opted for a brighter colour scheme in my own design, with a cool teal background and a highly-contrasted pink colour as my call-to-action. Not only did this make the site visually impactful, but allowed for ease of accessibility for those with colour blindness and other visibility issues. <br><br>

            We were also required to make a fully responsive website that could be viewed on desktops, laptops, tablets, and phones. While utimately I managed to achieve this, I initially struggled with learning about the flex property and how its nuances worked. Eventually, I found that physically planning (i.e. drawing on paper) which items needed containers around them in order to wrap in the desired way was a method that really helped me think through the design logically, and is a method I still use today when designing my websites in the initial stages of wireframing. <br><br>

            While many students opted to place a photo of themselves in their portfolio, I wanted to be cautious about preemptive judgement from those viewing my portfolio based on my appearance. Instead, I utilised the OpenPeeps library to create a small cartoon of myself to be used on the website. I personally was very pleased with the result, and I feel that it tied the overall aesthetic of my website together into something fun, approachable and creative. <br><br>
